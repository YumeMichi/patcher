Subject: [PATCH 22/32] stagefright: Fix SurfaceMediaSource getting handle from
 wrong position issue

In function passMetadataBuffer_l, the bufferHandle(ANativeWindowBuffer) is
saved to data (VideoNativeMetadata) but in function getMediaBufferHandle it
gets the bufferHandle from (MediaBuffer*)buffer->data() + 4, which is a wrong
position. To solve this problem, we should get handle from ANativeWindowBuffer,
not from buffer->data() + 4. (If get bufferHandle from buffer->data() + 4, the
function signalBufferReturned will print "returned buffer was not found in the
current list" error.

Test: Running wifi display, we can see the handle could be found in buffer list.
